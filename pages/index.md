      Hello, I'm Cyril Figuin, I'm 21 years old and I come from Reunion Island.

  - >
      I'm currently a student at ENSEEIHT (Digital Sciences Department - Systems and Software Engineering).

  - >
      I'm also interested in software and web development. So I trained myself personally in web development (HTML/CSS) for example.
      
  - >
      In addition, I am also interested in the audiovisual field: I'm thus fully involved in my school's video association: TVn7, of which I've been president since May 2020.
  - >
      To finish, I am sociable, organized, enterprising and I love teamwork.
